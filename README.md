The following text adventure game is created based on the TV series Merlin, season one episode 4. The game is extremely loose that the only common things are the characters names, a few scenes and the actual mission.

Merlin is almost dying after drinking Arthur's goblet which had been poisoned by Nimueh, a sorcerer who posed as a Mercian handmaiden named Cara so that she could poison prince Arthur. Gaius, a witch doctor of the palace, discovers a poisonous flower petal stuck inside the chalice and explains to Arthur that an antidote can only be made from the leaves from the same flower, the Mortaeus which is found in the caves beyond the Forests of Balor. Gaius also adds that going to the forest would be dangerous and no one might make it back. Arthur insists on going and Gaius leaves him with one advice, that he should not trust any wild animal in the forest since they do not exist and if he sees one it might not be real. The mission of the game is to help Arthur to go to the forest and get the flower before Merlin dies.


Game Structure

The game consists of three stages, a win and a fail global define functions. No bugs and errors.

First Stage - The player needs to help Arthur figure out which path to follow since there are two paths heading into the forest.

Second Stage - Inside the forest, Arthur meets with Nimueh disguised as a maiden claiming to have run away from her abusive master. He needs to make a decision whether to trust the maiden, fight a Cockatrice standing on his way or look for another alternative. Remember to consider time in your decision.

Third Stage - The player needs to help Arthur make a wise decision since Nimueh has casted a spell making it difficult for Arthur to secure the flower.
